If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
We don't trust you niggas, we don't
(I don't trust no motherfuckin' body)
We don't trust you niggas, we don't
We don't trust you
We don't trust you niggas, we don't
We don't trust you niggas, we don't (Smiling faces)
We don't trust you niggas, we don't (Show no traces)
(Of the evil that lurks within)
We don't trust you
